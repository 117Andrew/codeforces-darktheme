# Codeforces Dark Theme

A dark theme built for Codeforces.

**Built with accessibility in mind**: All colors used clear the minimum AA accessibility contrast ratio of 4.5:1, while most of them also clear the AAA contrast ratio of 7:1.

## Download instructions

## External dependencies

Both are for dark theme syntax highlighting of code.

1. [prettyprint's desert.css](https://github.com/google/code-prettify/blob/master/styles/desert.css), since Codeforces depends on the same library for formatting submission's display.
2. [Ace editor's monokai.css](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ajaxorg/ace/master/lib/ace/theme/monokai.css) since Codeforces' submission codebox uses the Ace editor.
